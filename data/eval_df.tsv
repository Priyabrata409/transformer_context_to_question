"&lt;a href=""http://voguefabricsstore.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-skinny-on-thinsulate.html"" target=""_blank""&gt;3M CS150 Thinsulate Thermal Jacket Insulation. 4.6 oz. per yard. 60in wide. Priced per yard. The perfect interlining for winter jackets, blankets, and other winter specialty clothes. Put a barrier of warmth between you and the elements by adding a layer of Thinsulate in between your outer fabric and your lining. &lt;span style=""COLOR: #ff0000""&gt;Sew this as an interlining. Use your lining pattern pieces to cut the Thinsulate, then stitch the Thinsulate to the lining before sewing to the outer fabric.The quilted side should face the outer fabric and the flat side should face the lining. Some 25 years ago, Thinsulate insulation was introduced as the originalwarmth without bulkin insulation &lt;a href=""http://voguefabricsstore.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-skinny-on-thinsulate.html"" target=""_blank""&gt;(click here for detailed information). And it virtually revolutionized the insulation industry overnight.In fact, when equal thicknesses are compared, it provides about 1-1/2 times the warmth of down and about twice the warmth of other high-loft insulation materials. And because Thinsulate insulation absorbs less than 1% of its weight in water, it retains its insulating ability even in damp conditions. The unique microfibers of Thinsulate insulation are about ten times smaller than the fibers of other synthetic insulations, which means theyre much more efficient at trapping air. . . and more effective at keeping you warm and comfortable. It also means more fibers can be packed into the same space, where they can reflect back more of the bodys radiant heat. &nbsp;<br /> &lt;span style=""COLOR: #ff0000""&gt;Care Instructions: Thinsulate is machine washable and dry cleanable once you have secured it inside the project.

Our casting material can be used for many other projects! Great for masks, sculptures, scenery and textured art.', ""We tested both medical-grade casting material and artist's casting material in our testing process. We chose the artist's casting material over the medical-grade casting material because the artist's casting material makes a smoother cast due to the finer cotton gauze and more generous and creamier gypsum contained on the cotton gauze. The medical-grade casting material uses a coarser gauze and there is not as much gypsum contained on the gauze. It also dries a more off-white color than the artist's casting material. The casting material is made from 100% natural materials and is non-toxic and safe to use on mom's skin.

383	What is the best sealant to put over the paint for outdoor stepping stones?	Glow Inc.'s glow in the dark paint is made from Grade 0 Strontium Aluminate pigments in a durable, high adhesion acrylic medium. Two pounds of top grade pigment per gallon of medium produces the brightest glow in the dark paint available. Glow in the dark paint absorbs bright light as energy. When placed in the dark, glow in the dark paint releases this energy as a glow. You can repeat this cycle millions of times. Applied properly, glow in the dark paint will lose 5% of its brightness every 10 years. Any light will charge the paint. Direct sunlight, high wattage bulbs, or black lights are needed to obtain the maximum glow. Glow in the dark paint is often used for professional murals and to paint glow in the dark stars on ceilings. Due to its durability, it is also perfect for painting glow in the dark fishing lures and outdoor signs. Each color has a different brightness and glow duration. The Green V10 is the brightest and will glow throughout the night. Glow Purple does not glow very brightly and requires a high wattage charging source. Check the brightness rating for comparison. Sealing coats are not needed. Paint over white surfaces when possible. It is critical that you apply this paint at least 1/16' thick (4 oz per sq. foot) for proper glow and a smooth appearance. Glow in the dark paint is shipped ready to use with a standard brush or roller. Thin with acrylic thinner or a tiny amount of water. Clean up with soapy water. We do not recommend that our glow in the dark paints be applied to the skin or hair. For the brightest, professional stars, put the paint in a baby feeding syringe. Use pressure on the plunger to squeeze out tiny 1/16' cones of glow in the dark paint. Use 2 Ounces of Green V10 Glow in the Dark Paint for a typical room, preferrably on a white ceiling. Paint additional stars near the top of the walls as well.	ask_question

The differential feed ratio, which is adjustable from .05 to 2.25, provides increased control for handling all types of fabrics and for creating desired special effects. Threading is a breeze due to color-coded thread guides and a self-threading lower looper. Simply lay the thread into the guide, flip a switch, and the lower looper is threaded. The guide is automatically returned to its normal position when you turn the balance wheel. And when you lift the presser foot for rethreading, the thread tensions are automatically released so you can draw the thread smoothly. The MyLock 634D also lets you quickly switch to rolled hemming without changing the needle plate. A lower looper pre-tension stitch eliminates the need to change tension for rolled hems.	ask_question

497	Is this a portable unit? Does it have to stay plugged in or can you charge it and then take it to different locations?	The TIM10 CO2 Monitor lets you quickly, accurately, and inexpensively test CO2 levels around your home. Move it from room to room to test CO2 levels in your house. It can reveal if your home's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system is operating properly. High CO2 levels indicate inadequate or closed return air ducts. Low CO2 levels indicate too much fresh air and wasted heating or cooling energy. In addition to its CO2 meter, the TIM10 has an accurate digital thermometer and relative humidity indicator. Use it to test your child's bedrooms. Low humidity in the winter can lead to nosebleeds, coughs, and sore throats. High humidity in the summer can result in mold and even structural damage. Do you own a greenhouse? Increasing CO2 makes flowering plants, vegetables, and seedlings grow bigger and faster. Working in the garage? Kerosene heaters, gasoline and diesel engines give off huge clouds of CO2 in addition to more deadly gasses.

544	Why is goat's milk not listed in the ingredients list?	Benefits of using This Soap Base The soap base is made from glycerin that has been extracted from pure coconut oil and goat's milk. The glycerin is distilled and deodorized twice, for a nice bar of soap that can be scented to suit your personal tastes. This soap base is also free of surfactants and is alcohol free. The soap base is also great for making aromatherapy soaps; since the soap base has been deodorized, the wonderful smell of your favorite essential oils fragrance the bar. Also, deodorizing the glycerin allows you to use less essential oil, saving time and money. The soap base is great for using with molds, and won't stick to even the most intricate soap mold. This soap base is also known to keep its' clearness, rather than yellowing (as other soap bases are known to do). Additionally, the soap base is made with skin moisturizing glycerin, which is know to draw moisture from the air into the skin. This white soap base is free of any animal fats, and will rinse cleanly off of skin.	ask_question

585	How often does it need to be cleaned out?	What makes our <b>Lint Trap Filter</b> so unique is not only its ability to efficiently capture lint, but to filter the air from the dryer as well. It does this by using a patented fine screen and water drawer system which prevents fine particles of lint from recirculating back into the dryer causing damage or fires. <br>The screen also has the added benefit of recycling the heat from your dryer which will not only lessen your impact on the environment, but save you money on your next heating bill as well. <br><br><b>Our indoor dryer vent has a fine stainless steel screen does not need replacement,</b> they will last as long as the unit. In addition, we've even made cleaning the screen an easy task to do. <br>By simply rotating the knob on the front of the unit once, you can scrape all of the lint off of the back of the filter without having to take it apart and having to touch any of the lint. The lint from the screen will be dropped in the water drawer (which already captured the dust and larger lint pieces). At this point all you have to do is empty the drawer, put fresh water in it and slide it back in place.<br> WATER? Yes, our lint trap filter uses water to cleanse the vented air of lint, fine particles and dust. Water provides a much better result than filters alone. <br>Some of our customers recommended putting a drop or two of their favorite essential oils into the water drawer, which will leave your house smelling great while you're drying your clothes!<br>Comes equipped with an <b>8 foot hose and 2 clamps</b>.<br> <br> Please note: this unit is <b>not recommended for gas dryers.</b>	ask_question

Spray Booth includes 1 each of this filter. 3rd Stage: A carbon-impregnated polyester (poly-carb) offering odor and further particle-trapping efficiency. Spray Booth includes 1 each of this filter. The 1530 Spray Booth fan develops 370 CFM of air flow. The spray guard hood can also be replaced.

This motor delivers up to 1/3 horsepower and is constructed for decades of extended use. The motor is designed for high speed sewing on multiple layers of various fabric weights. <br /><br /> <strong>Knee Lifter Included</strong> <br /><br />The knee lifter allows for hands-free raising and lowering of the presser foot and is vital for sewing multiple layers of thick fabric. The extra-high knee lifter provides 9.0 mm (0.35 inch) of lift, allowing for more layers of fabric to be sewn than on conventional sewing machines. If the knee lifter is not used, the traditional presser foot lifter allows for 6.35 mm (0.25 inch) of lift. The knee lifter can also be adjusted to operate stitch width. While in use, the knee lifter can be moved from left to right to taper the stitch as desired. This is helpful when appliqu&eacute;ing and freehand embroidering. The stitch width can also be adjusted using a lever on the front of the machine. <br /><br /> <strong>Versatile Design for Range of Applications</strong> <table align=""right"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""5"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""border:1px solid #666565"" width=""250""> <tbody> <tr bgcolor=""#d71f27""> <td align=""center"" colspan=""2"" style=""font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;font-weight:bold;color:#ffffff"">Singer 20U-109 Complete Motor Power</td> </tr> <tr bgcolor=""#bcbec0""> <td align=""center"" colspan=""2""><img alt=""Tool Spec"" border=""0"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Singer/SingerWatts._V155076364_.jpg"" width=""325"" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /><br />The 20U-109 Complete is the perfect machine for tailors, seamstresses, home decorators, fashion designers, dry cleaners, and industrial sewers.
